Timeline & Progress Report
---------------

### Timeline

We used gantt chart to manage our plan and schedule.
- [Gantt Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KbovW27ciVdclzW3kYWYgyjgxLC8OU-mRbYSotVAn8Q/edit?usp=sharing)

### Progress Report

We estimated our plan based on how much time we have for each iteration and evaluated how much we achieved. This will help us to alert where we are in the project and to manage our schedule.

|__Plan__|__Iteration 1__|__Iteration 2 (~ing)__|__Iteration 3__|__Iteration 4__|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Total SP Remaining|62 SP (0 %)|51 SP (18 %)|21 SP (66 %)|0 SP (100 %)(Expected)|
|Desired Features|UC 39, 41, 92 user stories|Remaining tasks of iteraion 1 and UC 88, 89, 90 user stories|Remaining tasks of iteraion 2 and UC 91, custom user stories|Remaining tasks of iteration 3 and testing, coverage|
|Desired SP|17 SP|36 SP|21 SP|   |
|Expected Velocity|17 SP / 1 iteration|36 SP / 1 iteration|21 SP / 1 iteration|   |
|Actual Velocity|11 SP / 1 iteration|30 SP / 1 iteration|-|   |
|Time we can spend|51 Hours|98 Hours|66 Hours|   |
|Time per SP|4.64 Hour / 1 SP|3.27 Hour / 1 SP|-|   |

Risks
---------------
These are possibly occurred risks that team members have to keep in mind of.  
Anaylsis is based on the method named 'Failure Mode and Effects Analysis(FMEA)'.  
Higher RPN implies that those risks have high risk.

|__Risk__|__Possiblity of Occurence__|__Impact of The Loss__|__Possibility of Detection__|__RPN(Risk Priority Number)__|__Mitigation Strategies__|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|A member cannot attend a general meeting or a pair programming meeting, but can work in remote.|2|3|1|6|Use TeamViewer.|
|A member cannot attend a general meeting or a pair programming meeting, and cannot work in remote.|2|4|2|16|Move a meeting schedule temporarily.|
|A scheduled meeting cannot be made by inevitable accident such as natural disaster.|1|4|6|24|Move a meeting schedule temporarily.|
|A member gets ill.|1|4|5|20|Keep meeting going and inform him of meeting contents.|
